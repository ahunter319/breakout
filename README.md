# Breakout

***

The classic brick breaking game. Player uses 'a' and 'd' keys to control the paddle across the screen to bounce the ball into the colored bricks. Each brick color changes the ball's speed, so watch out!

### How to use

***

Simply download the executable, double click, and play! Or you could always run it from the command line, if you're feeling fancy. Unfortunately the program will only work on Windows. Sorry Mac/Linux users!
